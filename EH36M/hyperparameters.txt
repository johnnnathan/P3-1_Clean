Training Parameters and Justifications

batch_size: 8
Balances GPU memory usage and training stability. Small batches are better suited for variable-length event data and fit well on the RTX 4060 GPU.

epochs: 30
Provides enough iterations for the model to converge without overfitting. Beyond 30 epochs, performance improvement was negligible.

learning_rate: 1e-4
Standard value for Adam optimizer. Allows stable convergence and avoids large gradient updates common in regression tasks.

max_events: 800
Limits the number of event points per frame to reduce memory usage while keeping meaningful temporal and spatial information.

train/test split: 80% / 20%
Standard practice to ensure a good balance between learning and generalization.

optimizer: Adam
Adaptive learning rate optimizer. Works well with noisy, sparse event-based input and improves training stability.

loss function: MPJPE (Mean Per Joint Position Error)
Measures average Euclidean error between predicted and ground-truth joints (in pixels or units). Standard metric in pose estimation.

d_model: 32
Latent dimension for Transformer embedding. Large enough to capture spatial-temporal structure but small enough to prevent overfitting.

num_heads: 2
Uses two attention heads to capture event-spatial interactions without excessive model complexity.

num_layers: 2
Uses a shallow Transformer encoder to maintain computational efficiency and prevent overfitting on small pose data.

num_workers: 4
Uses parallel data loading to improve throughput during training.

pin_memory: True
Accelerates data transfer from CPU to GPU, improving training speed.

CUDA AMP (autocast + GradScaler): Enabled
Enables mixed precision training, reducing memory usage and speeding up operations on RTX 4060.

torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark: True
Allows PyTorch to optimize low-level operations for faster training.

allowed_actions: Directions, Discussion, Greeting, Phoning, Posing, Sitting, SittingDown, Waiting, Walking, WalkTogether
These actions are movement types relevant to human-robot interaction, classroom behavior, and social/gestural motions in the EDMO scenario. Other actions like Smoking, Purchases, WalkingDog, TakingPhoto were excluded as irrelevant.
